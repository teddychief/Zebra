ANOVA example using Waterhole count data of Zebra counted in different paddocks of the same area


Open the Code.ipynb file so you can get a simple preview of the  code I used for the ANOVA, Zebra waterhole count. 

Please note this is not actual count data but self-generated values to show how statistics/Data Science works in Ecology for the Sibanye Dev fest for the Zim-Developers community [Youtube Link to be added here]
